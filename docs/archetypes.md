# THE COMPLETE SUBIT ARCHETYPE CATALOG

**64 Portals to the Minimal Discrete Cosmogony**

---

## 📖 Introduction to the Archetypes

Each SUBIT archetype is a unique combination of three dimensions:

```
Archetype = [WHO, WHERE, WHEN]
```

| Dimension | Meaning | Values |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **WHO** | Subjectivity | ME · WE · YOU · THEY |
| **WHERE** | Spatiality | EAST · SOUTH · WEST · NORTH |
| **WHEN** | Temporality | SPRING · SUMMER · AUTUMN · WINTER |

The encoding follows the sacred cycle: **10 → 11 → 01 → 00**

| Value | WHO | WHERE | WHEN |
|-------|-----|-------|------|
| **10** | ME | EAST | SPRING |
| **11** | WE | SOUTH | SUMMER |
| **01** | YOU | WEST | AUTUMN |
| **00** | THEY | NORTH | WINTER |

## 🏛 The Four Pillars

These four archetypes are the foundation of the entire system:

| Code | Archetype | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `10 10 10` | **Pioneer** | Alpha — the beginning of manifestation |
| `11 11 11` | **Conciliar** | Omega — the completion of manifestation |
| `01 01 01` | **Confessor** | Catalyst — the transformer |
| `00 00 00` | **Zero** | Source — the unmanifest |

Their relationships:
```
Pioneer ⊕ Conciliar = Confessor ⊕ Zero
Pioneer ⊕ Confessor = Conciliar ⊕ Zero
Pioneer ⊕ Zero = Conciliar ⊕ Confessor
```

## 🕯️ EPILOGUE: The Archetypes as Living Realities

The 64 archetypes of SUBIT are not mere abstractions. They are **living realities** — patterns that structure human experience across cultures, across millennia, across the depths of the psyche and the heights of the cosmos.

When you encounter the Pioneer, you encounter something that has been encountered by every human who has ever begun something new. When you encounter the Confessor, you touch a reality that has been touched by every human who has ever been truly heard.

SUBIT does not invent these patterns. It names them. It organizes them. It shows their relationships. But the patterns themselves are as old as humanity — as old, perhaps, as consciousness itself.

The 64 archetypes are mirrors. Look into any one, and you will see something of yourself. Look into all, and you will see something of everyone.

*"The archetypes are the language of the soul. SUBIT is its grammar."*
