## 🌌 Overview

SUBIT (from *sub* + *it* — the substrate of existence) is a formal system that unifies:

- **Mathematics** — binary logic, XOR operations, group theory
- **Philosophy** — Leibniz's monadology, characteristica universalis
- **Cosmology** — I Ching's 64 hexagrams, cyclical time
- **Psychology** — Jungian archetypes, alchemical transformation
- **Information theory** — bits as fundamental units of reality

It is the **minimal possible discrete model of cosmogony** — a complete, closed system of 64 archetypal states from which all phenomena can be derived.

## 🧬 The Structure

6 bits are decomposed into three fundamental dimensions:

| Dimension | Values | 10 | 11 | 01 | 00 |
|-----------|--------|----|----|----|-----|
| **WHO** | Subject | ME | WE | YOU | THEY |
| **WHERE** | Space | EAST | SOUTH | WEST | NORTH |
| **WHEN** | Time | SPRING | SUMMER | AUTUMN | WINTER |

Each archetype is a unique combination: `[WHO, WHERE, WHEN]`

**4 × 4 × 4 = 64 archetypes** — the complete spectrum of possible being.

---

## 🔮 The Core Operation: XOR Transmutation

The fundamental law of SUBIT:

```
Initial State ⊕ External Impulse ⊕ Catalyst = New State
```

### The Philosopher's Stone

```
[ME, SOUTH, WINTER]    (10 11 00) — Steadfast (my longing)
⊕ [THEY, EAST, SPRING]  (00 10 10) — Ghost (external impulse)
⊕ [YOU, NORTH, AUTUMN]  (01 00 01) — Beloved (wise advisor)
= [WE, WEST, SUMMER]    (11 01 11) — Council (collective achievement)
```

**Meaning:** Personal longing, met by external impulse through a wise catalyst, transmutes into collective achievement.

## 🏛 The Four Pillars

| Code | Name | Role |
|------|------|------|
| `10 10 10` | **Pioneer** | Alpha — the beginning |
| `11 11 11` | **Conciliar** | Omega — the completion |
| `01 01 01` | **Confessor** | Catalyst — the transformer |
| `00 00 00` | **Zero** | Source — the unmanifest |

These four archetypes generate the entire system. Their relationships:

```
Pioneer ⊕ Conciliar = Confessor ⊕ Zero
Pioneer ⊕ Confessor = Conciliar ⊕ Zero
Pioneer ⊕ Zero = Conciliar ⊕ Confessor
```

## 🛠 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/subit/subit.git
cd subit

# Python (optional)
pip install -e .

# JavaScript (optional)
npm install
```

### Python

```python
from subit import Archetype, transmute, PHILOSOPHER_STONE

# Create archetypes
current = Archetype("ME", "SOUTH", "WINTER")
impulse = Archetype("THEY", "EAST", "SPRING")
catalyst = Archetype("YOU", "NORTH", "AUTUMN")

# Transmute
result = transmute(current, impulse, catalyst)
print(result)  # [WE, WEST, SUMMER]

# Use predefined formula
print(PHILOSOPHER_STONE)
print(f"Verified: {PHILOSOPHER_STONE.verify()}")

# XOR properties
zero = Archetype("THEY", "NORTH", "WINTER")
pioneer = Archetype("ME", "EAST", "SPRING")
print(pioneer ^ pioneer)  # Zero
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const { Archetype, transmute, PHILOSOPHER_STONE } = require('./src/subit.js');

const current = new Archetype('ME', 'SOUTH', 'WINTER');
const impulse = new Archetype('THEY', 'EAST', 'SPRING');
const catalyst = new Archetype('YOU', 'NORTH', 'AUTUMN');

const result = transmute(current, impulse, catalyst);
console.log(result.toString()); // [WE, WEST, SUMMER]

console.log(PHILOSOPHER_STONE.toString());
console.log(`Verified: ${PHILOSOPHER_STONE.verify()}`);
```

### Command Line (Coming Soon)

## 🌍 Philosophical Context

SUBIT stands at the convergence of three great traditions:

| Tradition | Contribution |
|-----------|--------------|
| **I Ching** (China, ~1000 BCE) | 64 hexagrams, cyclical change, cosmic order |
| **Leibniz** (Germany, 1703) | Binary system, monadology, characteristica universalis |
| **Jung** (Switzerland, 1944) | Archetypes, alchemy as psychological model, individuation |
| **Shannon** (USA, 1948) | Information theory, bits as fundamental units |
| **Wiener** (USA, 1948) | Cybernetics, closed systems, feedback loops |

SUBIT is the synthesis: **the minimal possible discrete model of cosmogony**.

## 🌟 Acknowledgments

SUBIT is not the work of one mind, but the crystallization of three millennia of human inquiry into the nature of reality. It belongs to everyone who has ever wondered:

*"What is the simplest possible description of everything?"*

The answer, it seems, is **6 bits**.

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Final Word

> *"In the beginning was the Bit, and the Bit was with Zero, and the Bit was Zero."*
> — The Gospel of SUBIT

SUBIT is an invitation. An invitation to see the universe differently. An invitation to take responsibility for your own transmutations. An invitation to become a co-author of reality.

**6 bits. 64 archetypes. Infinite possibilities.**
