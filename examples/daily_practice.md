# Daily SUBIT Practice

## Morning Ritual (5 minutes)

### 1. Diagnose Your Current State

Ask yourself three questions:

| Question | Options | Your Answer |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Who am I now?** | ME / WE / YOU / THEY | ____ |
| **Where am I now?** | EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH | ____ |
| **When is this?** | SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER | ____ |

**Write your state:** `[___, ___, ___]`

### 2. Choose Your Target State

Where do you want to be by the end of the day?

**Target:** `[___, ___, ___]`

### 3. Find the Formula

Using the formula `Current ⊕ Impulse ⊕ Catalyst = Target`:

- What impulse do you need from the world? (THEY state)
- Who or what could be the catalyst? (YOU state)

**Impulse needed:** `[___, ___, ___]`  
**Catalyst needed:** `[___, ___, ___]`

### 4. Set Your Intention

Speak aloud:

> *"Today I embody [current archetype name].*
> *I open myself to [impulse archetype name] as an impulse,*
> *and to [catalyst archetype name] as a catalyst.*
> *I intend to transmute into [target archetype name]."*

## Evening Reflection (5 minutes)

### 1. Review the Day

- Did the impulse appear? How?
- Did the catalyst appear? How?
- Did the transmutation occur? Partially? Fully?

### 2. Journal
Date: ________

Current state this morning: [___, ___, ] — [name]
Target state: [, ___, ___] — [name]

What happened today:

Impulse experienced: _____________________________
Catalyst encountered: ____________________________

Final state this evening: [___, ___, ___] — [name]

Transmutation: ☐ Complete ☐ Partial ☐ Did not occur

If I could live today again, I would:

## Example Entry

**Morning:**
- Current: [ME, NORTH, WINTER] — Anchoret (lonely, still, in inner winter)
- Target: [WE, SOUTH, SUMMER] — Conciliar (shared joy, connection)
- Impulse needed: [THEY, EAST, SPRING] — Ghost (unexpected invitation)
- Catalyst needed: [YOU, WEST, AUTUMN] — Confessor (a friend who listens)

**Intention:** "Today I embody the Anchoret. I open myself to the Ghost as an impulse, and to the Confessor as a catalyst. I intend to transmute into the Conciliar."

**Evening:**
- A friend I hadn't seen in months called unexpectedly (Ghost appeared)
- We met for coffee, and I opened up about my isolation (Confessor appeared)
- I felt genuine connection and warmth (Conciliar achieved)
- Transmutation: Complete ✓

## Advanced Practices

### The 40-Day Transformation

Choose one target archetype. For 40 days:

1. Each morning, identify the impulse and catalyst needed
2. Each evening, journal the results
3. After 40 days, assess: have you integrated this archetype?

### Group Practice

With 2-3 partners:

1. Each person shares their current state
2. Group discusses: what impulse and catalyst might help?
3. Check in weekly on progress

### Ritual Space

Create a small altar with:
- Symbols for the four directions (EAST, SOUTH, WEST, NORTH)
- Objects representing the four seasons
- A representation of the Four Pillars

Use this space for morning intention-setting and evening reflection.
